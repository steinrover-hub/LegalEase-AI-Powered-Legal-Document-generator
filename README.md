## Overview

LegalEase AI is a web platform designed to simplify complex legal documents using structured AI agents. Users can upload agreements, policies, contracts, and other legal files, and the system automatically generates simplified summaries, risk assessments, and visual flowcharts for faster understanding. The project demonstrates the practical use of generative AI for legal assistance, clarity, and accessibility.

## Core Features

* **User Authentication**
  Secure signup and login with a modern UI.

* **Document Upload Support**
  PDF upload with OCR processing for scanned files.

* **AI Agent Pipeline**

  * PDF Reader Agent (OCR + text extraction)
  * Summarization Agent (section-level simplification)
  * Structuring Agent (risk and clause analysis)
  * Flowchart Agent (visual representation of key relationships)

* **Interactive Chat Interface**
  Users can ask clarifying questions about the uploaded document.

* **Modern UI Design**
  Clean, minimal interface prioritizing readability and structure.

---

## How It Works

1. The user authenticates and uploads a legal document.
2. The document is stored in Google Cloud Storage.
3. The PDF Reader agent extracts and preprocesses text.
4. The Summarization and Structuring agents analyze the content.
5. The Flowchart agent produces a visual logic diagram of key clauses.
6. Users view results through a dashboard and chatbot interface.

## Workflow

1. User logs in.
2. PDF document is uploaded and stored.
3. OCR extracts text where necessary.
4. AI agents analyze and structure document content.
5. Flowchart and simplified summary are generated.
6. Processed results are delivered through the dashboard and chatbot.
